mpr121
======

..  code-block:: cpp

    mpr121(name)[.i2c(sda,scl)][.with_address(i2c_address)];

Create a new MPR121 capacative touch sensor device.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic and corresponding
values will be published directly as a string of the length 12 with zeros and
ones corresponding to the 12 ports at the MPR121, showing a 1 if the port is
touched and a 0 otherwise.

Parameters
----------

- ``name``: the name it can be addressed via MQTT in the network. Inside the code
  it can be addressed via IN(name).

- ``.i2c(sda,scl)``: move i2c to given ports - if not specified uses default 
  i2c ports

- ``.with_address(i2c_address)``: the i2c_address is the address of MPR121
  capacitive touch sensor. Default address is 0x5A, but depending on wiring
  can also be 0x5B, 0x5C, or 0x5D.

With ``.with_filter`` a filter function can be specified: (see uhelp filter).

Example
-------

node name: ``toyroom/controller1``:

..  code-block:: cpp

    mpr121(cap1);

Now the status of the 12 touch ports is returned on
``toyroom/controller1/cap1``.
