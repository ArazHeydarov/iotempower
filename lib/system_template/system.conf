# Configuration for a iotempower system
# Everything from etc/iotempower.conf can be overwritten here.
# However, you will usually just overwrite the MQTT-Host and maybe
# wifi access information

# Name of accesspoint to connect to
#IOTEMPOWER_AP_NAME="iotempire"

# Its wifi password
#IOTEMPOWER_AP_PASSWORD="internetofthings"

# Connect data for local MQTT broker
