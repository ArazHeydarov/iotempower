IoTempower Tmux Help
====================


Welcome to IoTempower, your friendly and affordable Internet of Things
environment. For more info, check http://github.com/iotempire/iotempower.

Use the Escape key (ESC) or CTRL-Q to close this help. Use CTRL-A H to show it
again. CTRL-A H means: press the A key (do not press the shift key extra only
when specified as SHIFT), while holding the CTRL-key, release both, then press
the H-key.

You can scroll through this help with the cursor keys as well as using the
scroll wheel on your mouse or scroll gestures on your touchpad. If you want to
search, use CTRL-F (enter search word and later use n or p for next or
previous).

The terminal here is not a totally normal terminal, it is a terminal
multiplexer based on tmux (http://github.com/tmux/tmux). Why do you want this
in IoTempower, you ask? This allows you to reconnect to your terminal session,
even if you got disconnected.


Tmux Keyboard Shortcuts
-----------------------

However, tmux allows you to do other very helpful things with your terminal
session which are described here briefly (attention: these keyboard shortcuts
are modified from the default tmux shortcuts).

- CTRL-A CTRL-SPACE or CTRL-A SPACE: Enter tmux copy-mode.
  This allows you to select text from your session (the output of the programs
  you recently ran in this terminal. You can leave copy mode with CTRL-Q or
  pressing the Escape key. You can mark something in copy mode with clicking
  and dragging the mouse or pressing CTRL-SPACE and pressing CTRL-C to copy
  the selection to the clipboard.
- CTRL-A E: Open all the output of the current session in a text editor for
  easier search and copying
- CTRL-A CTRL-Q (or CTRL-A D): Disconnect from the current session, but keep
  everything in that session running.
- CTRL-A N: Create a (n)ew window (like a tab in your browser).
- CTRL-A T: Set a new (t)itle of the current window (tab).
- CTRL-A K: (K)ill/terminate the current session, everything is terminated in
  the current session.
- CTRL-A RIGHT (right arrow key): Select next window (tab) to the right (next).
- CTRL-A LEFT (left arrow key): Select next window (tab) to the left (previous)
  (you can also use your mouse to click on different tabs in the status bar
  below and switch to them).
- CTRL-V: The current version of tmux for IoTempower allows you to use CTRL-V
  anywhere to insert the current clipboard.


Commands to Help Directly at the Command Prompt
-----------------------------------------------

There are also some other helpful key combinations and commands which help you
working directly at the command prompt (of the shell, which is called bash) or
the command line which might come in handy, so they are listed here for
reference:

- CTRL-C: in the command line does not copy anything, it interrupts the
  currently running command.
- CTRL-Z: will suspend the currently running program. You can then use
- CTRL-X CTRL-E: edit current command line in the editor (very nice, if you
  want to use the mouse and standard CTRL-C, CTRL-X and CTRL-V key bindings
  to handle long commands).
- man <command>: typing man <command>, gives you a manual page on the specific
  command <command>.
- man tmux: typing man tmux at the comamnd-line will give you further help on
  tmux.
- tmux list-keys: typing list-keys gives you a list of all keybindings defined
  in tmux.
- mc: opens an easy to use file-manager, which can be controlled with the
  mouse. Look also at mc's user menu as it has several commands to help you
  with IoTempower.


IoTempower-Specific Commands
-------------------------

All these commands need to be typed in at the command line (and executed by
typing enter).
- iot help: shows a complete list of IoTempower commands, type iot help.
- iot help <command> or uhelp: shows you more information on the specific
  node command <command> (like typing help("<command>")
- iot upgrade: allows you to upgrade to the newest version of IoTempower


Have fun inventing the next Internet of Things system!
